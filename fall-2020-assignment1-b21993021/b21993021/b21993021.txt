I was graduated from Selim Nevzat Åžahin Anatolian High School. I am studying Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Hacettepe University.
I like listening music and playing games.

I acknowledge that i have fully read and understood the contents of the course website, I will not share
my work (not even a part of it) on Piazza, I will be responsible for what has been discussed/asked on
Piazza; I will not expect any response for my questions that have already been asked or written in a 
language other than English. I understand that If I have any questions or concerns about the course 
mechanics, it is my responsibility to discuss them with the instructors within their office hours.
